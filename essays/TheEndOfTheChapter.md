Being a student in ICS 314 has taught me a lot of things. While there are things I'm expected to learn in a computer science class such coding, coding languages, or making websites, there are many other things you can learn that don't necessarily have to be applied to only the class itself.

## Living By Standards

Having to live by standards can be a nag, but if we didn't have rules or laws, what would happen to the world we live in? With that in mind, when it comes to coding, there is always a "higher-up" looking over you, ensuring that you abide by the standards. If you don't, similar to driving in the real world, you'll see flashing red and blue lights behind you! Except the flashing and the blue... You'll see a red indicator to let you know that there is something not particularly correct about your code. If you guessed ESLint, then you are correct! ESLint is a coding utility that checks if you've violated any coding standards. Like mentioned earlier, if you have, there will be a red indicator to let you know. Likewise, in the real world, people like teachers and the police ensure that we follow the rules and laws (AKA Standards). If you don't, they'll get onto you about it.
