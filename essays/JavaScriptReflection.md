When I first used FreeCodeCamp, I was a bit worried. I thought that I would be practicing code in unfamiliar territory - that I would be behind before the class had even gotten the chance to start. I thought of myself to be a complete newbie when it came to JavaScript and coding in general. This was mainly due to the fact that in my past ICS classes, there were students who clearly knew the course material from prior experience. They completed all assignments with ease and did more than they needed to.  As I continued through the exercises, however, I was able to get through many of them with ease. On the few that I didn't know right off the bat or that I didn't recognize at all, a refresher on the material helped me pick my pace back up.

I couldn't say quite the same when I continued on to the ES6 exercises. There was a balance between "I learned this before!" and "Wow, what's happening here?". The exercises were new, yet familiar at the same time, and I can happily say that I'm glad I wasn't pulling my hair the ENTIRE time.



I can't fully call myself a pro when it comes to JavaScript, and neither can I call myself a newbie. I can say, however, that I'm someone who is willing to put in time and effort into learning new course material.
