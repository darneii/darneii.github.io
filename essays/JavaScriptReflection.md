When I first used FreeCodeCamp, I was a bit worried. I thought that I would be practicing code in unfamiliar territory - that I would be behind before the class had even gotten the chance to start. However, these are the few times where I'm happy to say that I'm wrong. As I continued through the exercises, everything started flowing back into me. I was able to get through many of them with ease, sometimes without reading the problem on the left side because I could tell what needed to be done on the right. On the few that I didn't know right off the bat or that I didn't recognize at all, the information on the left helped me pick my pace back up.

I couldn't say quite the same when I continued on to ES6. There was a balance between "I learned this before!" and "Wow, what's happening here?".
