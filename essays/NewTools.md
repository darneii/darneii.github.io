Since the start of this class, I've been introduced to new resources that I have had no clue about before. I would feel intimidated when learning how to use any new resource because I know that when it comes to coding, if there is something slightly off about your code, the whole program will fail. Github, for example, wasn't easy to get used to since there would be a few minutes before the changes put in would actually show up on the website. I felt at home with jsfiddle because I coded Java before in Eclipse, so I was familiar with the coding style I needed to use. Now that we've moved onto IntelliJ IDEA, I can say that I enjoy using it.

I thought ESLint would make IntelliJ difficult to use - that I'd have to make fixes upon other fixes. Interestingly, it was the opposite. When I would check the errors indicated by ESLint, the only errors I would really get are for spellings of words. I thought it was strange, but it was only because when I named variables, I would put together two words such as "number" and "array" to get "numArray". I do this to help me code easier so that I don't get confused with other variables. I feel that getting used to ESLint was easy because when I previously coded in Eclipse, I learned how to format my code properly since it was strict on spacing and indenting. If I left the code as "let i = 0 ;", there would be error because of the space between 0 and ;. If I didn't indent the code inside of a for-loop, there would also be errors. It was frustrating to get used to at first, but looking back at it now, I'm glad I dealt with those frustrations back then so that getting comfortable with IntelliJ would be a breeze. Getting the green check marks from ESLint isn't as painful as I thought it'd be.
