Since the start of this class, I've been introduced to new resources that I have had no clue about before. I would feel intimidated when learning how to use any new resource because I know that when it comes to coding, if there is something slightly off about your code, the whole program will fail. Github, for example, wasn't easy to get used to since there would be a few minutes before the changes put in would actually show up on the website. I felt at home with jsfiddle because I coded Java before in Eclipse, so I was familiar with the coding style I needed to use. Now that we've moved onto IntelliJ IDEA, I can say that I enjoy using it.
