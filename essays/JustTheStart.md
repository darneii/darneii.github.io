## Learning

I would love to learn

## Moving Forward

I hope to get as much as I can out of this class. I don't have too much familiarity in terms of language, but I hope to increase my knowledge all around, whether it be about coding or web development. I want to be proficient in many languages so that if the time comes, I won't fall behind everyone else. I know that there is much to learn, so I will do my best in this class to stay on top of my game.
