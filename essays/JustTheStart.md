## Learning

Before the start of my college years, I had wanted to become a doctor, mainly because of the "Filipino tradition". After being an ICS student for at least two years now, I am pleased to say that I'm glad I made this as my major. I learned so much more than I'd ever hoped for, and I know that moving forward, this class holds a lot in store for me. I've only had the slightest experience when it comes to web development since I had to make a webpage for my history class, but I know that that was just the bare minimum.

I'm interested in learning the ins and outs of programs and softwares. Currently, my vision of software engineering is blurry, so I'm hoping to change that. I want to develop my social and coding skills more. Currently, the in-class WODS are helping me to do that, especially since we're put into at least groups of 2. I have someone to keep me on track in case I get lost or forget a small detail, and I can put my coding skills to the test.

## Moving Forward

I hope to get as much as I can out of this class. I don't have too much familiarity in terms of language, but I hope to increase my knowledge all around, whether it be about coding or web development. I want to be proficient in many languages so that if the time comes, I won't fall behind everyone else. I know that there is much to learn, so I will do my best in this class to stay on top of my game. The description of software engineering in my mind is vague, but I'm looking forward to changing that.
