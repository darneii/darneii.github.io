The "smart" question I came across came from a developer who wanted to know how to remove a [git submodule](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260748/how-do-i-remove-a-submodule). I see this as a smart question because they showed that they attempted to do it on their own by asking why they can't input "git submodule rm whatever". While the "whatever" potion may throw it off and make it seem as if it's not a smart question, they want to know the reasoning behind why they can't use it. The answers to the question also proves that it's a smart question because those who answered explained 

The "not so smart" question I came across was from a developer who wanted to know how to print out the [contents of an array using a for-loop](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/accessing-the-index-in-for-loops). While they did provide code on their attempt to do so, they also asked to access the loop index from 1 to 5. Just like in Java, in Python, the index of arrays start at 0. Many of the answers (including the top rated) did not mention that factor, so if one were to use the code provided by the first answer they saw, they would see that it starts at 0 and not 1, so there may be complaints about it not starting from 1. The second answer provided code that would lead the print count to start at 1, so if one were to try to look for a fix, they would not have to look far. Had that person not provided another answer to the question, there would be those left puzzled.

After reviewing the questions amongst others on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), I know what to and what not to do when it comes to asking questions myself. It may take practice to get used to developing the "smart" questions, but doing so would allow answers to be more useful to not only myself, but to others who may have the same questions themselves. I would hate to see others think that even after seeing the answer and trying to utilize it, their code doesn't work properly and would lead to more problems than there needed to be.
