Going into ICS 111, I was a complete newbie when it came to coding. I had no previous knowledge with coding because I had not taken any coding classes in high school. The class consisted of using the Eclipse program to code everything with Java as the language.

It was through this project that I was able to apply my coding skills and to test if I could program what was required. I was still learning Java, so working on this project was stressful, but enjoyable at the game time. I made mistakes throughout the development of the game, but I learned a lot from them to produce this final result. I was really proud of this project because after just a few months of learning, I was able to produce a game with mechanics including hitboxes.
