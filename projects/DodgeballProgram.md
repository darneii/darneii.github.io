Going into ICS 111, I was a complete newbie when it came to coding. I had no previous knowledge with coding because I had not taken any coding classes in high school. I had a semi-rough start to the class, but I was really looking forward to what was in store. The class consisted of using Eclipse to code everything.

It was through this project that I was able to apply my coding skills and see if I could program what was required.  I was really proud of it because after just a few months of learning, I was able to produce a game.
