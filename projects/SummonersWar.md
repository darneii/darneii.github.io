Summoners War is a game in which you collect various types of monsters to defeat monsters put in by the game and those used by other players. As you progress through the game, you will obtain various awards that allow you to improve your monsters. While you can use real-life money to obtain rarer monsters and gain an edge on other players, it is possible to beat those who do without using money.

Just like many games, you can join a guild with other players to play content specifically for guilds. I chose to make my own guild and have others join me instead of me joining them. I don't want my guild members to feel intimidated, so I socialize with them quite often and give them guidance on the game should they need it. I have co-leaders to help me manage my guild so that I don't have to hold the responsibility all on my own. When it comes to battling other guilds, I make sure to communicate and work with my guild so that we can win the battles. Guild battles are 1-on-1, while siege battles are 1v1v1 (three guilds fight each other). If we work together and take over the proper battle towers, we're able to win the battle against the opposing guild(s).

Through this game, I've been able to develop my management and social skills. Without proper management, the guild could easily fall apart in the blink of an eye. The same can be said for socializing. If I were to not talk to my guild members, they wouldn't feel welcome and would try to find another guild to join. But, I can proudly say that I've had this guild since I first started playing this game and we're still going strong till today.
